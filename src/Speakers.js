              Design is at the heart of building successful businesses and
              products, right? In his 17 years of leading design teams, Henrik
              has crafter design centric organizations and grown designers to
              become most influential people in the companyâ€”and in his talk he
              removes design from the center of it all. Henrik proposes an
              inclusive world view and approach for designers that increases
              their influence, and makes them more impactful.
