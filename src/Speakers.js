              Design is at the heart of building successful businesses and
              products, right? In his 17 years of leading design teams, Henrik
              has crafted design-centric organizations and molded designers to
              become the most influential people in their companiesâ€”and in his
              talk he removes design from the center of it all. Henrik proposes
              an inclusive worldview and approach for designers that increases
              their influence and makes them more impactful. Henrik is currently
              the VP of Design at Jetty, a financial services startup for
              everyday renters.
